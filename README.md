# gradBot - a Chatbot to help University of Maryland Graduate School applicants and current students. 
## Aimed to simplifiy requests sent to the GS and provide useful infromation to students and prospective students. 

###This is a simple chatbot, using JavaScript DOM, some jquery. 
####Right now, it does not do very much as I haven't added any more response clauses in the rive document, but I will eventually. I am currently working on the UI.



# Functionality goals:
#### 1. Good UX with a good UI.
#### 2. Great use cases.
#### 3. Some sort of messages count which tracts most common replies. (Note to me: you formatted it in JSON charts.js could help!) 
#### 4. Submission contact form?
